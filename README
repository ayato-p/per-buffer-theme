per-buffer-theme.el
===================
Change theme according to active buffer name or major mode.

*per-buffer-theme.el* is an Emacs library that automatically changes
the global theme according to buffer name or major mode.

It runs as a function advice to *select-window* so it is not perfect.

If buffer name matches any of *per-buffer-theme/ignored-buffernames-regex*
no theme change occurs.

Customizable variable *per-buffer-theme/themes-alist* contains the
association between themes and buffer name or major modes.

Special *notheme* theme can be used to make unload all themes and use
emacs default theme.

If no theme matches then it'll load the theme stored in
*per-buffer-theme/default-theme*.
