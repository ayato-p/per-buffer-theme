per-buffer-theme.el
===================
Change theme according to active buffer name or major mode.

*per-buffer-theme.el* is an Emacs library that automatically changes
the global theme according to buffer name or major mode.

It runs through *window-configuration-change-hook* so it is not perfect.
If buffer name matches any of *pbt/ignored-buffernames-regex* no theme
change occurs.

Customizable variable *pbt/themes-plist* contains the association
between themes and buffer name or major modes.

Special *notheme* theme can be used to make unload all themes and use emacs
default theme.

If no theme matches then it'll load the theme stored in *pbt/default-theme*.
If none is found uses default theme stored in `pbt/default-theme'.
Special `notheme' theme can be used to disable all loaded themes."
